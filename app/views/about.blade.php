                QuViews is a place for holding civil discussion. Do not post disingenuously, or in an inflammatory manner for the sole purpose of upsetting others.
                Negative commentary and minority opinions are not frowned upon, but members are expected to be able to substantiate their positions.
                At the same time, do not derail threads around yourself or attempt to respond to every single reaction among dozens after posting a comment that is reacted to severely en masse.
                </p>

                <p>
                You agree, through your use of this service, that you will not use QuViews to post any material which is knowingly false and/or defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane,
                sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person's privacy, or otherwise in violation of any law.
                Sexual, racial, or ethnic slurs will not be tolerated in any form and are bannable on the first offense.
                It is recommended that profanity be held to a minimum in order to keep the level of discourse high, and profanity should not be used when addressing others.
                Though QuViews is an international website, discussion is to be held in English unless otherwise designated.

                Images of a sexual or profane nature are discouraged. Images presenting exposed genitalia, bared buttocks,
                and/or female nipple/aureola are not allowed.
                Outside of this, common sense and a "safe-for-work" rule should be the primary considerations.
                Do not spam meme images or any other image macro.
                Avatar images should be static and entirely "G-rated" and family-friendly.
